# realtimestocks
1. Created a project named as Djangoapp.
2. Created an app stocks.
3. In stocks I have integrated Tiingo API for real time prices including its Highs and Lows.
4. http://127.0.0.1:8000/stocks/ will fetch data from ticker.html.
5. We can write any stocks name for its real time data. For example: goog for google, f for ford or appl for aaple.
6. After writing stocks name, we will get a page which will fetch data from ticker.html.
7. In that page we will have a hyperlink for user who wishes to buy stocks they can put query.
8. Query page will fetch data from contact.html.
